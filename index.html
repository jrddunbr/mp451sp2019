    <h2>COSI Stuff</h2>
    <p>
      Kept the lab clean, participated in all meetings. Cleaned the room (including washing the floors) with Josh Gordon.
    </p>
    <!--  Forum topics: VoIP phones for the labs, Colo Progress (a lot), Firewall modifications, COSI websites situation, bulletin board, room cleaning, QFX 3500 purchase, feet stink and we can't sleep in the academic buildings -->
    <!--  Project Updates: vpn, Electrical Age, dubsdot-cfg, others -->
    <!--  Announcements: mirror.cslabs.clarkson.edu supports IPv6 now! -->
    <p>
      Gave 2 lightning talks:

    <p>
      It is planned to give a PGP keysigning party soon.

    <h2>FOSS Projects</h2>

    <p>
      See my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub</a> and my <a target="_blank" href="https://gitea.cslabs.clarkson.edu/jared">Gitea</a> accounts for stuff.
    </p>

    <h3>dnssd</h3>

    <p>
      dnssd (the domain name system server daemon) is a piece of software using ed25519 cryptography to dynamically assign domain names to different computers. Not finished, but a protocol RFC has been created and a partial implementation as well. Written in Python
    </p>

    <h3>Electrical Age</h3>

    <p>
      I've been contributing to Electrical Age development over the last year with Graham Northup, and intend to continue development through next semester and beyond. Administrating the most popular fork of a popular Minecraft mod is a great way to learn about how to handle an effective Git workflow, as well as working with other people.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>eln-matrix-viz</h3>

    <p>
      eln matrix vis is a compiler from a special output format from an Electrical Age debugging command to dot files. These dot files can then be passed into GraphViz to create neat images of connected node graphs
    </p>

    <h3>Outlet</h3>

    <p>
      A Git repository full of cancerous code. I made some contributions, and also learned how Git hooks work. All of the "Build failing" in the makefile from my Git user are because I had a pre-commit hook to add that text, so every time I commited, it added that.
    </p>

    <h3>Laundry</h3>

    <p>
      A python script designed to fetch json from the LaundryView website and tell me what washers and dryers are available in all of the buildings, and how much longer they have to completion, so that I can see how my laundry is doing.
    </p>

    <h3>wtherm</h3>

    <p>
      IoT hacking of a WiFi enabled meat thermometer. We discovered how to parse some of the packets well enough to get the temperature from the probe, and set the temperature to beep at. Apparently, you can do many other horrible things like set the currently read temperature by fuzzing the packets.
    </p>

    <h3>cisco</h3>

    <p>
      I worked on documentation for the Cisco 7000's. More work to be done, would love help.
    </p>

    <h3>interwebs-o-trash</h3>

    <p>
      I created some scripts and packet dumps from some of the msc IoT stuff I left for people to play with in COSI.
    </p>

    <h2>Server Stuff</h2>

    <h3>Network Stuff</h3>

    <p>
      Mirror and a bunch of other services now have IPv6 addresses. We also have an IPv6 reverse delegation now as well. I also re-wired the entire COSI side of the patch panel and made documentation for that as well. All of the ports have been tested and punched down, should be good.
    </p>

    <h3>Virtual Machines</h3>

    <p>
      Moved COSI from Gogs to Gitea.
    </p>

    <h3>Servers</h3>

    <p>
      replaced nas1's operating system with an Ubuntu install.
    </p>

    <h2>ITL Stuff</h2>

    <p>
      Continuing to run the ITL, also handing off slowly. Make sure it's clean, everything working. Had to have some hardware replaced by OIT due to hardware failure of various kinds.
    </p>
